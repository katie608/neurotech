Create a document for your future self, which details how to approach a data analysis problem.

### Some basic probability terms and concepts
- Conditional probability P(A|B)
- Bayes rule and how to use it
- Probability Mass Function and Cumulative Distribution Function
- Why are outliers important?
Outliers will skew the mean in favor of their direction; for example, a really high outlier will raise the mean. Outliers will also increase the standard deviation regardless of whether they are higher or lower than the mean. Outliers donâ€™t usually affect the median or mode very much.
- P-values: P value represents the probability that a result this extreme or more extreme would happen by random chance if the null hypothesis is true.
- What is the difference between a statistically significant event, and a large effect size?
- False positive vs False negative, and the sort of paradox about them

### How to test a hypothesis
Based on this:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1un3ktVI5TszrWPqvOtlkFC-b8ghoYDOqR86uorV5A_Y/edit
1. Plot the data, understand the data, know the data
2. Check for missing data, and remove missing data points as necessary, or determine another way to deal with them (substitute in the mean?)
3. Define the problem. What exactly is the question that you are trying to answer?
4. Figure out which test to perform
5. Perform the test
6. Interpret the results: make a graph, write whether or not the null hypothesis was accepted or rejected

### How to do Machine learning in Matlab
(If I get to this, might be good information to remember, since matlab's classification learner tool lets you easily and quickly run a lot of different models on the data, which is helpful for figuring out which type of model might work the best)
